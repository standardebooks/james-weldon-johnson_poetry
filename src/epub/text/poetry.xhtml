			<p>
				<span>Lift ev’ry voice and sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till earth and heaven ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our rejoicing rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High as the list’ning skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us march on till victory is won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stony the road we trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter the chast’ning rod.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with a steady beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not our weary feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out from the gloomy past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now we stand at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God of our weary years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God of our silent tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has by Thy might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led us into the light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shadowed beneath Thy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May we forever stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our native land.</span>

			<p>
				<span>O brothers mine, to-day we stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where half a century sweeps our ken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struck off our bonds and made us men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just fifty years—a winter's day—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As runs the history of a race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, as we look back o'er the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How distant seems our starting place!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look farther back! Three centuries!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To where a naked, shivering score,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snatched from their haunts across the seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This land is ours by right of birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This land is ours by right of toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We helped to turn its virgin earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where once the tangled forest stood,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cotton white, the yellow corn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To gain these fruits that have been earned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hold these fields that have been won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That Banner which is now the type</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of victory on field and flood—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remember, its first crimson stripe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet has come the cry—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When that fair flag has been assailed—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men to do, for men to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we have faltered or have failed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held in our hands, it has been borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And planted far across the seas.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet,—O haughty Land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let us, at least, for this be praised—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has one black, treason-guided hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever against that flag been raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then should we speak but servile words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or shall we hang our heads in shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fear our heritage to claim?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No! stand erect and without fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for our foes let this suffice—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We've bought a rightful sonship here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we have more than paid the price.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet, my brothers, well I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirit bowed beneath the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The staggering force of brutish might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long, vain waiting through the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear some voice for justice raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full well I know the hour when hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hands uplifted in despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Courage! Look out, beyond, and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The far horizon's beckoning span!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith in your God-known destiny!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We are a part of some great plan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because the tongues of Garrison</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Phillips now are cold in death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think you their work can be undone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Lovejoy was but idly slain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or do you think those precious drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That for which millions prayed and sighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for which tens of thousands fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which so many freely died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God cannot let it come to naught.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">O Black and Unknown Bards</h2>
			<p>
				<span>O black and unknown bards of long ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, in your darkness, did you come to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Heart of what slave poured out such melody</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As "Steal away to Jesus"? On its strains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His spirit must have nightly floated free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though still about his hands he felt his chains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who heard great "Jordan roll"? Whose starward eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw chariot "swing low"? And who was he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Nobody knows de trouble I see"?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What merely living clod, what captive thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find within its deadened heart to sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How did it catch that subtle undertone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That note in music heard not with the ears?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not that great German master in his dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the creation, ever heard a theme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nobler than "Go down, Moses." Mark its bars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That helped make history when Time was young.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from degraded rest and servile toil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fiery spirit of the seer should call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These simple children of the sun and soil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You—you alone, of all the long, long line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You touched in chord with music empyrean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You sang far better than you knew; the songs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still live,—but more than this to you belongs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.</span>

				<span>The memories of cruel sights and deeds,</span>

				<span>The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filtered through fifteen generations have</span>

				<span>Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.</span>

				<span>In me the muttered curse of dying men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On me the stain of conquered women, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wretches now long dead,—their dire bequests,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In me the echo of the stifled cry</span>

				<span class="i1">I claim no race, no race claims me; I am</span>

				<span>I am—just what I am. . . . The race that fed</span>

				<span>To-day, but I—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i7">Enough, the brute must die!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire much longer than this slender pine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now bring the fuel! Pile it 'round him! Wait!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The agony and terror in his face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames</span>

				<span>Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there's another! Wilder than the first.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searching around in vain appeal for help!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down through the coils of chain that hold erect</span>
				<br/>

				<span>The hand of Fate cannot be stayed,</span>

			<p>
				<span>See! In your very midst there dwell</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A wedge so slender at the start—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just twenty slaves in shackles bound—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, which split the land apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shrieks of war and battle sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which pierced the nation's very heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still lies cankering in the wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not all the glory of your pride,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Can from the judging future hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all the coming ages long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That though you bravely fought and died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You fought and died for what was wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>'Tis fixed—for them that violate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal laws, naught shall avail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they their error expiate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shall their unborn children fail</span>

			<p>
				<span>Think not repentance can redeem,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>No, think as well to change the scheme</span>

			<p>
				<span>O brothers mine, take care! Take care!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great white witch rides out to-night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trust not your prowess nor your strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your only safety lies in flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in her glance there is a snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her smile there is a blight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The great white witch you have not seen?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like nursery children you have looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But no, not so; the witch appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the glowing charms of youth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her lips are like carnations, red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her face like new-born lilies, fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She moves with subtle grace and air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all about her head there floats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden glory of her hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But though she always thus appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In form of youth and mood of mirth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unnumbered centuries are hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The infant planets saw her birth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The child of throbbing Life is she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twin sister to the greedy earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And back behind those smiling lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down within those laughing eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And underneath the soft caress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of hand and voice and purring sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of the panther lurks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirit of the vampire lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For I have seen the great white witch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she has led me to her lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have kissed her red, red lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cruel face so white and fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around me she has twined her arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bound me with her yellow hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I felt those red lips burn and sear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My body like a living coal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obeyed the power of those eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the needle trembles to the pole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did not care although I felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strength go ebbing from my soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard your laughter loud and gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in your voices she has caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The echo of a far-off day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When man was closer to the earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she has marked you for her prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She feels the old Antaean strength</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you, the great dynamic beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of primal passions, and she sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you the last besieged retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great white witch rides out to-night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, younger brothers mine, beware!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look not upon her beauty bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in her glance there is a snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her smile there is a blight.</span>
