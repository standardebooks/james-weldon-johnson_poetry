			<p>
				<span>Lift ev’ry voice and sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till earth and heaven ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our rejoicing rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High as the list’ning skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us march on till victory is won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stony the road we trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter the chast’ning rod.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with a steady beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not our weary feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out from the gloomy past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now we stand at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God of our weary years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God of our silent tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has by Thy might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led us into the light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shadowed beneath Thy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May we forever stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our native land.</span>
