			<p>
				<span>Lift ev’ry voice and sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till earth and heaven ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our rejoicing rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High as the list’ning skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us march on till victory is won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stony the road we trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter the chast’ning rod.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with a steady beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not our weary feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out from the gloomy past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now we stand at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God of our weary years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God of our silent tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has by Thy might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led us into the light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shadowed beneath Thy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May we forever stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our native land.</span>

			<p>
				<span>O brothers mine, to-day we stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where half a century sweeps our ken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struck off our bonds and made us men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just fifty years—a winter's day—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As runs the history of a race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, as we look back o'er the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How distant seems our starting place!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look farther back! Three centuries!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To where a naked, shivering score,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snatched from their haunts across the seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This land is ours by right of birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This land is ours by right of toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We helped to turn its virgin earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where once the tangled forest stood,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cotton white, the yellow corn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To gain these fruits that have been earned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hold these fields that have been won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That Banner which is now the type</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of victory on field and flood—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remember, its first crimson stripe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet has come the cry—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When that fair flag has been assailed—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men to do, for men to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we have faltered or have failed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held in our hands, it has been borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And planted far across the seas.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet,—O haughty Land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let us, at least, for this be praised—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has one black, treason-guided hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever against that flag been raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then should we speak but servile words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or shall we hang our heads in shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fear our heritage to claim?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No! stand erect and without fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for our foes let this suffice—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We've bought a rightful sonship here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we have more than paid the price.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet, my brothers, well I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirit bowed beneath the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The staggering force of brutish might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long, vain waiting through the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear some voice for justice raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full well I know the hour when hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hands uplifted in despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Courage! Look out, beyond, and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The far horizon's beckoning span!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith in your God-known destiny!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We are a part of some great plan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because the tongues of Garrison</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Phillips now are cold in death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think you their work can be undone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Lovejoy was but idly slain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or do you think those precious drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That for which millions prayed and sighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for which tens of thousands fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which so many freely died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God cannot let it come to naught.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">O Black and Unknown Bards</h2>
			<p>
				<span>O black and unknown bards of long ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, in your darkness, did you come to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Heart of what slave poured out such melody</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As "Steal away to Jesus"? On its strains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His spirit must have nightly floated free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though still about his hands he felt his chains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who heard great "Jordan roll"? Whose starward eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw chariot "swing low"? And who was he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Nobody knows de trouble I see"?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What merely living clod, what captive thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find within its deadened heart to sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How did it catch that subtle undertone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That note in music heard not with the ears?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not that great German master in his dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the creation, ever heard a theme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nobler than "Go down, Moses." Mark its bars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That helped make history when Time was young.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from degraded rest and servile toil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fiery spirit of the seer should call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These simple children of the sun and soil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You—you alone, of all the long, long line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You touched in chord with music empyrean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You sang far better than you knew; the songs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still live,—but more than this to you belongs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.</span>

				<span>You fought and died for what was wrong.</span>

				<span>O brothers mine, take care! Take care!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great white witch rides out to-night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trust not your prowess nor your strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your only safety lies in flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in her glance there is a snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her smile there is a blight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The great white witch you have not seen?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like nursery children you have looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But no, not so; the witch appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the glowing charms of youth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her lips are like carnations, red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her face like new-born lilies, fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She moves with subtle grace and air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all about her head there floats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden glory of her hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But though she always thus appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In form of youth and mood of mirth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unnumbered centuries are hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The infant planets saw her birth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The child of throbbing Life is she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twin sister to the greedy earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And back behind those smiling lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down within those laughing eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And underneath the soft caress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of hand and voice and purring sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of the panther lurks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirit of the vampire lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For I have seen the great white witch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she has led me to her lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have kissed her red, red lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cruel face so white and fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around me she has twined her arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bound me with her yellow hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I felt those red lips burn and sear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My body like a living coal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obeyed the power of those eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the needle trembles to the pole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did not care although I felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strength go ebbing from my soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard your laughter loud and gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in your voices she has caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The echo of a far-off day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When man was closer to the earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she has marked you for her prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She feels the old Antaean strength</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you, the great dynamic beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of primal passions, and she sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you the last besieged retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great white witch rides out to-night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, younger brothers mine, beware!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look not upon her beauty bright;</span>

				<span>Around the council-board of Hell, with Satan at their head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Three Great Scourges of humanity sat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaunt Famine, with hollow cheek and voice, arose and spoke,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"O, Prince, I have stalked the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my victims by ten thousands I have slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have smitten old and young.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mouths of the helpless old moaning for bread, I have filled with dust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have laughed to see a crying babe tug at the shriveling breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of its mother, dead and cold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have heard the cries and prayers of men go up to a tearless sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fall back upon an earth of ashes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, heedless, I have gone on with my work.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis thus, O, Prince, that I have scourged mankind."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Satan nodded his head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pale Pestilence, with stenchful breath, then spoke and said,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Great Prince, my brother, Famine, attacks the poor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is most terrible against the helpless and the old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I have made a charnel-house of the mightiest cities of men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I strike, neither their stores of gold or of grain avail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a breath I lay low their strongest, and wither up their fairest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I come upon them without warning, lancing invisible death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From me they flee with eyes and mouths distended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I poison the air for which they gasp, and I strike them down fleeing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis thus, great Prince, that I have scourged mankind."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Satan nodded his head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the red monster, War, rose up and spoke,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His blood-shot eyes glared 'round him, and his thundering voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Echoed through the murky vaults of Hell.—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"O, mighty Prince, my brothers, Famine and Pestilence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have slain their thousands and ten thousands,—true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the greater their victories have been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more have they wakened in Man's breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The God-like attributes of sympathy, of brotherhood and love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made of him a searcher after wisdom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I arouse in Man the demon and the brute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I plant black hatred in his heart and red revenge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the summit of fifty thousand years of upward climb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I haul him down to the level of the start, back to the wolf.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I give him claws.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I set his teeth into his brother's throat.</span>

				<span>I make him drunk with his brother's blood.</span>

				<span>But I draw Man hellward."</span>
			</p>

				<span>And he was a miser old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would trust no bank,</span>

				<span>He forgot just where he hid it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find his gold he tried and tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he grew faint and sick, and died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then on each dark and gloomy night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A form in phosphorescent white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A genuine hair-raising sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would wander through the town.</span>

				<span>With a spade it dug each foot of ground;</span>

				<span>Said there was no doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas the ghost of Deacon Brown.</span>

				<span>The passers-by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take wings and fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It would laugh in ghostly glee,</span>

				<span>Hee, hee!—it would laugh in ghostly glee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so the town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went quickly down,</span>

				<span>And doors and gates,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Bore a notice, "Tenants wanted."</span>

				<span>Are you bowed down in heart?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do you but hear the clashing discords and the din of life?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then come away, come to the peaceful wood,</span>

				<span>Do you not catch, yet faint, elusive strains?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are above, around, within you, everywhere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silently listen! Clear, and still more clear, they come.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bubble up in rippling notes, and swell in singing tones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now let your soul run the whole gamut of the wondrous scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, responsive to the tonic chord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It touches the diapason of God's grand cathedral organ,</span>
