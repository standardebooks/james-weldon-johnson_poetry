			<p>
				<span>Lift ev’ry voice and sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till earth and heaven ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our rejoicing rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High as the list’ning skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us march on till victory is won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stony the road we trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter the chast’ning rod.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with a steady beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not our weary feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out from the gloomy past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now we stand at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God of our weary years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God of our silent tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who has by Thy might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led us into the light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep us forever in the path, we pray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shadowed beneath Thy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May we forever stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to our native land.</span>

			</header>
			<p>
				<span>O brothers mine, to-day we stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where half a century sweeps our ken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struck off our bonds and made us men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just fifty years—a winter's day—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As runs the history of a race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, as we look back o'er the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How distant seems our starting place!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look farther back! Three centuries!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To where a naked, shivering score,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snatched from their haunts across the seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This land is ours by right of birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This land is ours by right of toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We helped to turn its virgin earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where once the tangled forest stood,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cotton white, the yellow corn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To gain these fruits that have been earned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hold these fields that have been won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That Banner which is now the type</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of victory on field and flood—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remember, its first crimson stripe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet has come the cry—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When that fair flag has been assailed—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men to do, for men to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we have faltered or have failed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held in our hands, it has been borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And planted far across the seas.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet,—O haughty Land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let us, at least, for this be praised—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has one black, treason-guided hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever against that flag been raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then should we speak but servile words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or shall we hang our heads in shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fear our heritage to claim?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No! stand erect and without fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for our foes let this suffice—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We've bought a rightful sonship here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we have more than paid the price.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet, my brothers, well I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirit bowed beneath the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The staggering force of brutish might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long, vain waiting through the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear some voice for justice raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full well I know the hour when hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hands uplifted in despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Courage! Look out, beyond, and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The far horizon's beckoning span!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith in your God-known destiny!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We are a part of some great plan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because the tongues of Garrison</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Phillips now are cold in death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think you their work can be undone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Lovejoy was but idly slain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or do you think those precious drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That for which millions prayed and sighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for which tens of thousands fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which so many freely died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God cannot let it come to naught.</span>
